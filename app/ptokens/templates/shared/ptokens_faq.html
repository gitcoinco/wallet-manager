        <p>Personal tokens are ERC20 tokens tied to different Gitcoin users. They represent a claim over listed uses like time, work and feedback. Each personal token is unique, and different tokens may be redeemed for specific uses.</p>

      <h5 class="accordion">Where do I see a user’s personal token?</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The best place to see a user’s token is directly on their Gitcoin Profile, under the Personal Token tab at the top of the page. This shows you how much their tokens cost, and exactly what they can be used for.</p>

      <h5 class="accordion">How do I use a personal token?</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Once you’ve acquired a personal token, you’ll need to submit a redemption request. 
        This request can be used on any of the Creators listed uses, and only for those uses. 
        Please note that it’s up to the creator to determine whether or not your request is appropriate, so please give them 24-48 hours to respond to your request.</p>

      <h5 class="accordion">What happens to my personal tokens when they are used?</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>When a Creator accepts your request, the equivalent amount of personal tokens is automatically burned and removed from the supply forever.</p>

      <h5 class="accordion">A Creator accepted my request and did not meet my expectations - What should I do?</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Under each profile you’ll see a feedback score. This is the main place where we can see how a creator is holding up their end of the bargain. Please submit an appropriate overview on what happened and we’ll look to see if further action needs to be taken.</p>
