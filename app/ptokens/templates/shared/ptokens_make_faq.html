    <div class="mb-3 faq-item">
      <h5 class="accordion">{% trans "What are personal tokens?" %}</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Personal tokens are ERC20 tokens tied to different Gitcoin users. They represent a claim over listed uses like time, work and feedback. Each personal token is unique, and different tokens may be redeemed for specific uses.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3 faq-item">
      <h5 class="accordion">What can I use a personal token for?</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Gitcoin personal tokens are tied to time. One token will always equal one hour of time and it’s up to you to determine how you’d like that time to be spent. The important thing to note is that personal tokens should represent your strengths. The more detail you can provide over what someone can expect, the more likely they are to purchase your tokens for future work.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3 faq-item">
      <h5 class="accordion">What happens when I create a token?</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Each token utilizes a unique smart contract for issuance and redemption. Upon creation, users will be able to send DAI directly to the contract in exchange for your tokens at the predetermined rate. You will receive that DAI directly to your connected web3 wallet.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3 faq-item">
      <h5 class="accordion">Where can I manage my tokens?</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Creators can actively manage all things Personal Token via the Dashboard under the Personal Token tab. Assuming you’ve already created a token, you’ll see a buttom to “Edit” your token’s price and to mint new tokens.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="mb-3 faq-item">
      <h5 class="accordion">Do I have to accept an incoming request?</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>You are entitled to only accept requests which you see fit. Please note that denying too many requests is likely to affect your reputation, so please provide the redeemer with detailed feedback as to why their request did not meet your standards so that they can revise their request to better suit your skills.</p>

    <div class="mb-3 faq-item">
      <h5 class="accordion">What happens when I accept a request?</h5>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Upon accepting a request, it is up to the redeemer to mark the task as completed. Upon the task being marked as complete, personal tokens are transferred out of their possession and back to your personal token contract.</p>
