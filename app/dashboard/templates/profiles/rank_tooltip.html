    Fun facts about these algorithms:
    <li>
      <strong>Range from 1-10</strong> - Each *Rank is scored on a range between 1 (lowest) and 10 (highest).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Compounding</strong> - If you are funded by a connector in the network, then that Rank is worth than if you are funded by a solitary user.
    </li>
