        After you have been registered, see TODO to improve your rating.
        <br/>
        Remember, if you publish open source, your rating will tend to improve.

        Registration is free (except of an Ethereum network fee). The earlier you register, the more money you get.
        </small>
        <br/>
        <small>
        No matter what happens, you will receive 1 token per second since the moment of registration till you die
        (or go inopt for corporations).
        <br/>
        Your salary exchange rate will be "calculated" by free market based on future predictions of your performance,
        such as your expected citations count in the future.
