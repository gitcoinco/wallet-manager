            <h2 class="font-title mt-5 c4" id="h.r37hhdfs3aq8"><span class="c2">4. ROLE OF GITCOIN</span></h2>
            <p class="c8"><span class="c0">You expressly acknowledge, agree, and understand that: the Site is merely a platform through which Posters and Hunters conduct transactions. Unless participating on the Site as a Poster, Gitcoin is not involved in the transactions, and has no control over the quality, safety, or legality of Tasks or consideration for Tasks, the ability of Hunters to perform Tasks to Posters&rsquo; satisfaction, or the ability of Posters to pay for Tasks. You are not an employee of Gitcoin, and Gitcoin does not, in any way, screen, supervise, direct, or control Hunters or services performed for or delivered to Posters &nbsp;(&ldquo;Hunter Services&rdquo;). Gitcoin will not have any liability or obligations under or related to Service Contracts (defined below) for any acts or omissions by you or other Users. Gitcoin has no control over Hunters or the Hunter Services offered or rendered by Hunters and Gitcoin makes no representations as to the reliability, capability, or qualifications of any Hunter or the quality, security, or legality of any Hunter Services, and Gitcoin disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. Use of the Site is at your own risk. Because Gitcoin is not a party to the transactions between Posters and Hunters, Gitcoin is not responsible for resolving any disputes between participants related to any Tasks.</span></p>
            <h2 class="font-title mt-5 c20" id="h.cyv74rfhac77"><span class="c2">5. GITCOIN POSTERS</span></h2>

            <h2 class="font-title mt-5 c17" id="h.kduzwod3rdxb"><span class="c2">7. WORK PRODUCT AND WORK FOR HIRE</span></h2>
            <p class="c8"><span class="c0">Hunter will perform the Hunter Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and will timely deliver any agreed upon tangible or intangible results or deliverables, including, but not limited to, configurations, computer programs, software, applications, or other information, and any intellectual property developed in connection therewith (&ldquo;Work Product&rdquo;). Where applicable, the Work Product must be submitted to Poster in open source format. </span></p>
            <p class="c8 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c8"><span class="c3">Any Work Product from Tasks performed as a Hunter is a &quot;work made for hire&quot; for the benefit of the Poster. Upon Hunter&rsquo;s receipt of full payment from Poster, the Work Product, including without limitation all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction </span><span class="c3 c30">(&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Intellectual Property Rights&rdquo;) in the Work Product, will be the sole and exclusive property of Poster, and Poster will be deemed to be the author thereof. If Hunter has any Intellectual Property Rights to the Work Product that are not owned by Poster upon Hunter&rsquo;s receipt of payment from Client, Hunter hereby automatically irrevocably assigns to Client all right, title and interest worldwide in and to such Intellectual Property Rights. Except as set forth above, Hunter retains no rights to use, and will not challenge the validity of Poster&rsquo;s ownership in, such Intellectual Property Rights. Hunter hereby waives any moral rights, rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal or inalienable rights under applicable law in and to the Work Product.</span></p>
            <p class="c8 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c8"><span class="c3">Hunter agrees that it will not incorporate into Work Product or otherwise supply Poster any deliverable for which the use or distribution of the code will create (or purport to create) obligations for Poster to grant any rights or immunities under Poster&rsquo;s intellectual property to a third-party, including without limitation any obligation that the Work Product or Poster software combined with, derived from, or distributed with such Work Product (a) be disclosed or distributed in source code form, (b) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or (c) be redistributable at no charge. </span></p>
            <h2 class="font-title mt-5 c20" id="h.j5wfry9hjl3h"><span class="c2">8. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS</span></h2>
            <p class="c22"><span class="c3">Hunters perform Tasks for Posters in their personal capacity as an independent contractor and not as an employee of a Poster or Gitcoin. As a Hunter, you agree that: (a) you are responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws and registration requirements, including those applicable to independent contractors and maximum working hours regulations; (b) these Terms do not create an association, joint venture, partnership, franchise, or employer/employee relationship between you and Poster, or you and Gitcoin; (iii) you will not represent yourself as an employee or agent of a Poster or Gitcoin; (iv) you will not be entitled to any of the benefits that a Poster or Gitcoin may make available to its employees, such as vacation pay, sick leave, and insurance programs, including group health insurance or retirement benefits; and (v) you are not eligible to recover worker&#39;s compensation benefits in the event of injury. As an independent contractor, Hunter is free at all times to provide Hunter Services to persons or businesses other than Poster, including any competitor of Poster. Hunter does not have authority to enter into written or oral (whether implied or express) contracts on behalf of Poster or Gitcoin. As a Poster, you will not engage a Hunter in any way that may jeopardize that Hunter&#39;s status as an independent contractor performing Tasks for you. Posters may not require an exclusive relationship.</span></p>
            <h2 class="font-title mt-5 c20" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c2">9. GITCOIN CONTRACTS</span></h2>
            <p class="c8"><span class="c0">As used herein, a &ldquo;Service Contract&rdquo; means, as applicable, the unilateral contractual provisions created by Poster that govern the Hunter Services to be performed by Hunter for Poster for a particular Task posted to the Site and which will typically include a description of the Task or Tasks to be completed, the amount and type of currency as compensation, and the deadline. &nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that Gitcoin is not a party to any Service Contracts, and that the formation of a Service Contract between any Posters and Hunters will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Gitcoin and Poster or Gitcoin and Hunter.</span></p>

            <p class="c5"><span class="c0">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY &ndash; IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT</span></p>
            <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.1. Initial Dispute Resolution</span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</span></p>
            <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.2. Binding Arbitration</span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c0">If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties&rsquo; relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</span></p>
            <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.3. Location</span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Binding arbitration shall take place in New York. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</span></p>
            <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.4. Class Action Waiver</span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The parties further agree that any arbitration or other permitted action shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND GITCOIN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</span></p>
            <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.5. Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Notwithstanding the parties&#39; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (&ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</span></p>
            <p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c2">22.6. 30-Day Right to Opt Out</span></p>
            <p class="c5"><span class="c3">You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Gitcoin</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&#8453; ConsenSys, 49 Bogart Street, Brooklyn NY 11206 and via email at notices@consensys.net,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with subject line &ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Gitcoin</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;LEGAL OPT OUT&rdquo;.

If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, </span><span class="c3">Gitcoin</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;also will not be bound by them.</span></p>
