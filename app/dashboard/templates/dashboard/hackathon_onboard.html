                  <p>Then, when your project is completed and you have submitted a pull request or set up a repository with your code and deliverables, it’s time to submit work! Submitting work allows judges to review see your work along with other submissions, and helps them pay you and your teammates out directly. Submit your work by clicking the <b>“Submit Work”</b> button on the prize page, right where the <b>“Start Work”</b> button was before (shown above). Note that you should have already clicked <b>“Start Work”</b> earlier for the <b>“Submit Work”</b> button to appear. Be sure to include your teammates Gitcoin addresses in your project’s readme/front page so that judges can pay them out, too.</p>
                  <p>And that’s it! Your submission will be reviewed by judges and, if you are the winning submission, you and your teammates will be paid the prize amount in cryptocurrency directly to the ETH address associated with your Gitcoin profile.</p>
