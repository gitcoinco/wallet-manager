Day 5: The Gitcoin Toolset

Abraham Maslow once said “If the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.".

Did you know that Gitcoin isn’t *just* bounties?   We’re building out whole a toolbox of OSS incentivization tools.

Here are a few
  CodeFund (https://codefund.io) -- Sustain your OSS project with ethical advertising
  Tips (https://gitcoin.co/tips) -- Got a project contributor that’s doing really great work
  Dev Grants -- Support your best contributors with a grant that recurs over time

Click on any of the tools above to take them for a test drive, or learn more about our toolbox at https://gitcoin.co/tools
