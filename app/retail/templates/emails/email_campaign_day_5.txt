Day 5: The Gitcoin Community

Community is what makes Open Source Work.  A strong OSS community is inclusive, helpful, and mission-oriented.

The Gitcoin community is 4000 software developers who are focused on the tooling for the new world. Is there a chance that your next career connection could come from the Gitcoin community? :thinking-face:

Here’s how you can get involved:

  Meet other Devs in the Gitcoin Slack (http://gitcoin.co/slack)
  Got an idea to improve Gitcoin? Participate in a GIP (https://github.com/gitcoinco/GIPs).
  Relax and enjoy demo’s from leading blockchain + open source projects on Friday afternoons at 5PM ET on our Community Livestream. Add to iCal* or Google Calendar**.
  Just want to stay in touch? Follow us on Twitter (http://twitter.com/getgitcoin).

The Gitcoin community is, ultimately, the value of our platform. We strive to remain open to any suggestions, requests, or thoughts you have of us. Come hang out and let’s grow open source, together.
