Day 2: Using Gitcoin’s Issue Explorer

Hey {{firstname}},

By this point, you might have poked around the Gitcoin Issue Explorer (https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=) to see the open source projects you could make money by contributing! If interested in doing work, here’s how:

Start Work
Click ‘Start Work’ to kick off a message to the repo-maintainer that you’re interested in the issue
Respond on the Github thread with your intended approach for the bounty

Make A Submission

  Download MetaMask (http://metamask.io/)
    MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web in your browser, today.
    It allows Gitcoin (an Ethereum based dApp) to run in your browser so you can use gas to claim an issue!

  Get some ETH (gas) in order to make a submission
    What is gas, you say? Gas is the payment sent to Ethereum miners, in exchange for execution of a smart contract.
    If you need a small amount of ETH to make a claim, request some using the Gitcoin Faucet (http://gitcoin.co/faucet)!

  Click on ‘Submit Work’ use your gas to make a submission!

From here, you should be off to the races! The repo maintainer will review your PR and pay out accordingly.
Feel free to poke your head in if you have any issues.

CTA: Check out the Issue Explorer (https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=) if you haven’t already! If you don’t find good fits,
let us know an open source project (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AeiKhCO2TefXo8wAbFerjxe2Vgci3ueqzzUpa-PFPLo/edit) that you’d like to see using Gitcoin.
No promises, but we might have something up our sleeve.
