Day 4: A Firehose Of Developers

Gitcoin Core is 4 team members, yet we've seen contributions from well over 35
developers using Gitcoin. We'd like to see you do the same!  Here's how to
leverage a firehose of developer talent to do more, faster.

Posting a bounty can be done in 90 seconds, once you know Gitcoin is an option
to accelerate your development.  Adding bounties to an existing project is like
adding icing to a cake.  We take what's already great about OSS (mission,
freedom, and great people) and add financial incentivization, a home base for
projects seeking contributors, funding for developer, and community.

Alongside posting bounties on the Issue Explorer, Gitcoin offers two
complimentary products for open source software enthusiasts.
