Day 4: Funding Issues With Gitcoin

We’re leaning on the community to suggest projects which might be interested in using bounties to accelerate their roadmap.
Posting a bounty is easily done in 90 seconds (https://medium.com/gitcoin/tutorial-post-a-bounty-in-90-seconds-a7d1a8353f75) once you know Gitcoin is an option to accelerate your development.

Adding bounties to an existing project is like adding icing to a cake.  We take what’s already great about OSS:

The mission
The freedom
The great people

And we add to it with:
Incentivisation mechanics
Developer flow
Funding
A community

Do you know an OSS project that might want to try bounties?
Let us know by filling out this form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AeiKhCO2TefXo8wAbFerjxe2Vgci3ueqzzUpa-PFPLo/edit).
If the project funds a bounty, we’ll send you a 15% finders fee.

If you are an OSS repo maintainer, Gitcoin can help you build a community around your product if used correctly.
We’re lucky we’ve been able to do so with our platform - here’s a bit more on how you can use Gitcoin to do so, too (https://medium.com/@owocki/dcd39650fc5)!
