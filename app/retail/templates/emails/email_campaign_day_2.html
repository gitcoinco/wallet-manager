    By this point, you might have poked around the Gitcoin <a href="https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=">Issue Explorer</a> to
    see the open source projects you could make money by contributing!
    If interested in doing work, here's how:

    </p>

    <h2>Start Work</h2>
    <p>
        {% blocktrans %}
        Click 'Start Work' to provide a brief message to the repo-maintainer that you‚Äôre interested in the issue

      <b>First, <a href="http://metamask.io/">download MetaMask</a></b> ü¶ä
      MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web in your browser, today.
      It allows Gitcoin (an Ethereum based dApp) to run in your browser so you can use <b>gas</b> to claim an issue!
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      <b>Then, get some gas</b> ‚õΩÔ∏è  What is gas, you say?
      Gas is the payment sent to Ethereum miners (ETH) in exchange for execution of a smart contract.
      If you need a small amount of gas, request some using the <a href="http://gitcoin.co/faucet">Gitcoin Faucet!</a>
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        {% blocktrans %}
        Click on ‚ÄòSubmit Work‚Äô use your gas (ETH) to make a submission! ‚ö°Ô∏è
        {% endblocktrans %}
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
    <img src='{% static "v2/images/email/submit-work.gif" %}' />
    </p>


    <p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    From here, you should be off to the races! The repo maintainer will review your PR and pay out accordingly.
    Feel free to poke your head in if you have any issues.
