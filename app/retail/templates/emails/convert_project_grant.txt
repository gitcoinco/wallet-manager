Get funding for your project by converting to Grant!

    Do you know that a lot of important companies in the Web3 space currently started out as hackathon projects?

    At Gitcoin, we believe every hackathon project is the start of something big. To get you started on your journey, now you're able to convert your project to grant!

    Simply go to your project, click the Convert to Grant button, and you'll be able to get funding from contributors and be eligible for CLR matching on Gitcoin Grants Rounds!
