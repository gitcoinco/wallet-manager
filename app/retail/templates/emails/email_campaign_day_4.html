    Gitcoin is an option to accelerate your development team! And best of all, it's easy and fast:
    <a href="https://medium.com/gitcoin/tutorial-post-a-bounty-in-90-seconds-a7d1a8353f75">Posting a bounty on Gitcoin is easily done in 90 seconds</a>

    Adding bounties to an existing project is like adding icing to a cake.  We take what’s already great about OSS:
    {% endblocktrans %}

    <ul>
      <li>The mission</li>
      <li>The freedom</li>
      <li>The great people</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      And we add to it with:
      {% endblocktrans %}
      <ul>
        <li>Incentivisation mechanics</li>
        <li>Developer flow</li>
        <li>Funding</li>
        <li>A community</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Do you know an OSS project that might want to try bounties?
      Let us know by <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AeiKhCO2TefXo8wAbFerjxe2Vgci3ueqzzUpa-PFPLo/edit">filling out this form</a>. If the project funds a bounty, we’ll send you a 15% finders fee.

      If you are an OSS repo maintainer, Gitcoin can help you build a community around your product if used correctly.
      We’re lucky we’ve been able to do so with our platform -
      <a href="https://medium.com/@owocki/dcd39650fc5">here’s a bit more on how you can use Gitcoin to do so, too</a>!
