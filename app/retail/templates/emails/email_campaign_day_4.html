        Gitcoin Core has 4 team members, yet we've seen contributions from well over 35 developers using Gitcoin.
        We'd like to see you do the same!

        <a href="https://medium.com/gitcoin/tutorial-post-a-bounty-in-90-seconds-a7d1a8353f75">
          Posting a bounty can be done in 90 seconds</a>,
        once you know Gitcoin is an option to accelerate your development.
        Adding bounties to an existing project is like adding icing to a cake. We take what's
        already great about OSS (mission, freedom, and great people) and add financial incentivization,
        a home base for projects seeking contributors, funding for developer, and community.

        Alongside posting bounties on the Issue Explorer, Gitcoin offers two complimentary products for open source
        software enthusiasts.
