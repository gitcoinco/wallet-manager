      Developing in blockchain can seem daunting.
      If you’re an experienced developer, however, your skills are already extremely useful in the blockchain space.
      We’ve found that many issues solved through Gitcoin are using skills in Python, JavaScript, Django, React and more.

      That being said, learning is a part of the fun at Gitcoin.
      You’ll be exposed to many projects building in Ethereum’s blockchain space,
      and will be exposed to concepts like web3 and languages like Solidity,
      the JavaScript based smart contract programming language.
