          A Permissions based project ensures that the contributor has <br/>
          necessary skillsets to complete the task. Contributors will request <br/>
          to work on a project by clicking start work to express interest. A<br/>
          short summary of a work approach will also be provided in the start <br/>
          work form.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <h3><b>What to Know </b></h3>
          <br/> 
          Gitcoin will send you an email notification when a worker has<br/>
          expressed interest.<br/>
          <br/>
          The repo owner/funder has the right to approve or deny any request<br/>
          to work.<br/>
          <br/>
          If there is no response from the funder/owner of the repo. Gitcoin will<br/>
          auto approve the contributor after 72 hours.<br/>

        <h3><b> Permissionless- No Approval Required</b></h3>
        <img src="{% static "v2/images/landing/contributor/neg.png" %}"/>
          <br/>
          A Permissionless project allows a contributor to begin work without <br/>
          permission or approval from the project owner. It is suggested that <br/>
          an approach and questions be raised prior the start of the project to<br/>
          ensure mutual understanding or the way forward.<br/>

          <h3><b>What to Know </b></h3>
